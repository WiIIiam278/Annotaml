Annotaml is a SnakeYAML wrapper for that provides an extremely easy and intuitive way of reading yaml (configuration) files to objects through Java annotations. 

No more messing around with reading keyed values from a file; directly annotate your objects to your liking and have Annotaml load them for you.
