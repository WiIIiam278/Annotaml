Annotaml is a library for generating YAML files from Java classes. It uses SnakeYAML for parsing and saving YAML files, providing an extremely easy and intuitive way of reading and writing yaml (configuration) files to objects through a set of Java annotations.

No more messing around with reading keyed values from a file; directly annotate your objects to your liking and have Annotaml load them for you.
